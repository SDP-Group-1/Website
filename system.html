          <p>"Around one in four adults above the age of 65 have experienced a fall in the United States." <br>- <abbr title = "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"><b>CDC</b></abbr></p>

    <p style = "color: white; font-size: large;">
      It is evident from the above statistics that falls are a very common issue in the elderly that is not often
    spoken about. However, elderly patients often find themselves 
    unassisted for long period of times, which further exacerbates their conditions.
    Prolonged wait times to receive assistance can lead to dehydration, further injury 
    which can lead to long recovery times, and even to pneumonia and death. Additionally,
    some users may have pre-existing conditions such as heart problems which may worsen 
    due to lack of medical attention. Such disablity could also prevent a patient from 
    manually setting off an alarm (like a pendant alarm, for instance). 
    </p>
  <p style = "color: white; font-size:large; padding-top: 10px;">Another interesting piece of information is this: </p>
  <div class="quote">
  <quote style = "color: whitesmoke; font-size: medium;">"Most falls, however, do not cause sufficient injury to receive medical attention.
     Only 3 to 5 percent of falls in elderly persons who reside in the community and in nursing
    homes result in fractures, with fewer than 1 percent of falls causing hip fractures. 
    Only about 5 to 10 percent of falls cause other serious injuries requiring medical care. 
    Between 30 and 50 percent of falls result in a variety of minor soft tissue injuries that
    do not receive medical attention; the remainder cause 
    <a style = "color: white;font-weight:bold;" href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235613/">
    no injury or only trivial damage.</a>"</quote>
  </div>
  <p style="color: #aaa; font-size: large;">This means that there is a growing problem of individuals
     older than 65 with a high fall risk and not <a style="font-weight: bold;">receiving the required help on time</a>.

        O.L.I. is a medical assistance robot that monitors the user's movements and 
        calls for help if a fall is detected. The system consists of two components: 
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- A robot with a circular steel bar (which we will simply refer to as O.L.I.)</li>
          <li>- A mobile application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        O.L.I. is capable of mapping the user's home and localising the user in 
        the event of a fall. The robot is fitted with a circular steel bar that will
        assist the user in getting up in the event of a minor fall. O.L.I. has a flat platform 
        on top that allows the user to place objects on it. Further extensions 
        that is being considered here is fitting it with a first aid box and a light misting 
        spray to wake the user in case they have fainted.

          <p style = "font-size: 3vh; color: #111;">
            O.L.I. also comes with a mobile application. The primary purpose of the app is to monitor
            the sensors present on a smartphone and determine if the user has fallen over. The app 
            also comes with a machine learning model that classifies sensor data into falls and 
            normal activities to provide a higher level of accuracy to the predictions. 
            The app comes with three main features - Call O.L.I., Set up and Fall detection demo. 
          </p>
                <hr style="background-color: white;"> 
                <p style = "font-size: 3vh; color: #111;"> 
                <b>Call O.L.I.</b> is a button that summons the robot to the user. This function does not wait for a fall event 
                to be detected, but rather allows the user to call the robot if they require it. 
              </p>
            
                <hr style="background-color: white;">
                <p style = "font-size: 3vh; color: #111;">
                <b>Set up</b> allows the user to enter their contact details, set up their WiFi and Bluetooth settings on their smart phone,
                and configure O.L.I. to map their home. This is the ideal first step the user should take after installing the 
                app for the first time.

                <b>Fall detection demo</b> is a prototype button. In our final version, this button would not exist as the fall detection 
                process would run in the background of the app. This button is present to highlight the different 
                steps present in the fall-detection procedure.

      <h2>Our Intention</h2>
      <p style="color:black;" class="text-justify">Fall detection systems for the elderly is an common area of research, but there are not a lot of 
        products in the market with respect to this. <br>We believe that a robot can provide minimal help to the elderly people with a high fall risk, 
        providing them with a sense of independence. This additionally releases the stress of the nurse and doctors from these tasks in care homes, as well 
        as provides the family of such patients with some relief. 
       We currently have robots that navigate through campuses, roads and restaurants already. This technology can be extended to hospitals or nursing homes and
       bring about real change in the lives of many.<br>

O.L.I. is currently not designed for a hospital setting, since we need more professional advice to deploy the robot in such sophisticated environment as well as immense 
amounts of user testing. However, we wish for it to be a robot that can be used by everyone, so we need to control the cost to make it affordable. 
This affects how we choose our material and parts to build the robot. 

After hours of brainstorming, our robot comes in a medium size, so it won’t affect people walking in the corridor, and have also decided to have extensible legs to support the human’s weight when lifting them up. 
Most people in today's world use a smartphone, so an app that detects falls would be convenient and does not need extra hardware to achieve that.
